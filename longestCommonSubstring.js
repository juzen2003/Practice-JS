// Write a function, longest_common_substring(str1, str2) that takes two strings and returns the longest common substring. A substring is defined as any consecutive slice of letters from another string.
//
// Bonus: solve it in O(m * n) using O(m * n) extra space. (Hint: the solution involves dynamic programming which will be introduced later in the course.)

const longestCommonSubstring = function(str1, str2) {
  
};
