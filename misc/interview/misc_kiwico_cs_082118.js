// SQL:
// join => inner join, Select all records from Table A and Table B, where the join condition is met.
// left join => left outer join, Select all records from Table A, along with records from Table B for which the join condition is met (if at all).
// right join => right outer join, Select all records from Table B, along with records from Table A for which the join condition is met (if at all).
// full (outer) join => Select all records from Table A and Table B, regardless of whether the join condition is met or not.

// JOIN is same as INNER JOIN and means to only show records common to both tables. Whether the records are common is determined by the fields in join clause. For example:
//
// FROM t1
// JOIN t2 on t1.ID = t2.ID
//
// means show only records where the same ID value exists in both tables.
//
// LEFT JOIN is same as LEFT OUTER JOIN and means to show all records from left table (i.e. the one that precedes in SQL statement) regardless of the existance of matching records in the right table.
//
// RIGHT JOIN is same as RIGHT OUTER JOIN and means opposite of LEFT JOIN, i.e. shows all records from the second (right) table and only matching records from first (left) table.
