1. explain event delegation
JS event listeners fire not only on a single DOM element but on all it's children

2. event bubbling
propagation

3. difference between target and current target

4. immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
expression resolves to a value

(function foo(){}) ()
-> make a statement to an expression when wrapping around ()

5. explain hoisting

let & const are blocked scoped and not hoisted

6. null undefined undeclared
x === undefined
y === null

7. difference between == and ===
==: check for equality
===: check for equality and type

8. event loop
