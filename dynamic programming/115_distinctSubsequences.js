// A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
// count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T

// dp: a 2D array to store number of unique subsequence of s.slice(0,i) which is equal to t.slice(0,j) in dp[i][j]
// 1. if length of s is less than the one of t, return 0
// 2. if length of t is 0, and s is not, the number of subsequence is 1
// 3. check if current character at s & t are the same:
// if the current character in S doesn't equal to current character T, then we have the same number of distinct subsequences as we had without the new character in S.
// if the current character in S equal to the current character T, then the distinct number of subsequences: the number we had before (without current character at s) + the distinct number of subsequences we had with less longer T and less longer S. (without current character at s & without current character at t)
